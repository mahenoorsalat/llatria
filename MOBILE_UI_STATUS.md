# Mobile App UI Status - What's Missing

## Current Situation
✅ **Stores & Logic**: All exist and work correctly
- `inventoryStore.ts` - Has all filtering, sorting, bulk operations ✅
- `toastStore.ts` - Toast notifications store ✅  
- `historyStore.ts` - Undo/redo functionality ✅
- All use `postingStatus` correctly ✅

❌ **UI Components**: Almost nothing is exposed
- Inventory screen is just a basic FlatList
- No search bar
- No filters UI
- No sorting UI
- No view mode toggle
- No bulk operations UI
- Toast component created but not used yet

## What Desktop Has That Mobile Doesn't (UI-wise)

### Desktop Inventory Page Has:
1. ✅ SearchBar component with history
2. ✅ InventorySidebar with filters:
   - Status filter (All, Active, Sold)
   - Platform filter (Facebook, eBay, Website)
   - Category filter (dropdown + multi-select)
3. ✅ SortAndViewOptions component:
   - Sort by: Date, Price, Name, Status, Category
   - Sort order: Ascending/Descending
   - View mode toggle (Grid/List)
4. ✅ BulkActionsBar for multi-select operations
5. ✅ AdvancedFilters modal (date range, price range)
6. ✅ Toast notifications everywhere
7. ✅ Export/Import functionality

### Mobile Inventory Screen Has:
1. ❌ Basic FlatList only
2. ❌ No search
3. ❌ No filters
4. ❌ No sorting
5. ❌ No view mode toggle
6. ❌ No bulk operations
7. ✅ Toast component created (needs integration)

## Solution
I need to systematically add UI components to the mobile inventory screen to expose all the existing store functionality. This will require:

1. Search bar component
2. Filter modal/sheet
3. Sort modal/sheet  
4. View mode toggle
5. Grid view component
6. Bulk selection UI
7. Toast notifications integration

This is a substantial UI update to match desktop functionality.
