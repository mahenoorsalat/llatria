# Features to Add to Mobile Inventory Screen

## Problem
The mobile inventory screen has ZERO UI features exposed, even though all the stores and logic exist:
- ✅ Stores exist (historyStore, toastStore, etc.)
- ✅ InventoryStore has all filtering/sorting logic
- ❌ UI doesn't expose ANY of these features

## Missing UI Components Needed

### 1. Search Bar ❌
- Need: TextInput component with search icon
- Use: `setSearchQuery()` from inventoryStore

### 2. Filter Button/Modal ❌
- Need: Filter icon button that opens modal/sheet
- Include: Status, Platform, Category filters
- Use: `statusFilter`, `selectedPlatforms`, `categoryFilter` from inventoryStore

### 3. Sort Button/Modal ❌
- Need: Sort icon button that opens modal
- Include: Sort by (date, price, name, status, category) + order (asc/desc)
- Use: `sortBy`, `sortOrder`, `setSortBy()`, `setSortOrder()`

### 4. View Mode Toggle ❌
- Need: Grid/List toggle button
- Use: `viewMode`, `setViewMode()`
- Need to create Grid view component

### 5. Toast Notifications ✅
- Component created but needs to be in _layout.tsx (DONE)

### 6. Bulk Operations ❌
- Need: Long-press or checkbox mode for multi-select
- Use: `bulkDelete()`, `bulkMarkAsSold()`

## Priority Order

1. **Search Bar** - Most important
2. **Filter Modal** - Critical for finding items
3. **Sort Options** - Important for organization
4. **View Mode Toggle** - Nice to have
5. **Bulk Operations** - Lower priority

## Implementation Plan

I'll systematically update the mobile inventory screen to add all these features, matching the desktop functionality.
