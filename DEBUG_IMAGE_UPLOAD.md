# Debug Image Upload Issue

## Steps to Debug

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12 or Cmd+Option+I in Electron)
2. **Check for console logs** when you upload an image:
   - Should see: "handleImageUpload called"
   - Should see: "Starting AI processing..."

3. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Look for POST request to `/api/ai/recognize`
   - Check if it's returning 401 (unauthorized) or other errors

4. **Verify Authentication**:
   - Make sure you're logged in
   - Check if `isAuthenticated` is true in the console

5. **Check Backend Logs**:
   - Backend should show incoming requests
   - Check for any errors

## Common Issues

1. **Not Authenticated**: Login first with test@llatria.com / test1234
2. **Backend Not Running**: Check http://localhost:3001/health
3. **Image Format Issue**: Make sure image is valid
4. **Silent Error**: Check browser console for errors

## Quick Test

Try this in browser console after uploading an image:
```javascript
// Check if function is being called
console.log('Uploaded images:', window.uploadedImages);
```
